# Shenjing-RTL
This is the RTL implementation of Shenjing, a low power neuromorphic computing accelerator. Shenjing.sv is the top design file.
The Shenjing work has been accepted by DATE 2020 conference. We create the repository here for anyone who is interested to know the details of how the Shenjing architecture works.
Please proceed to IEEE Xplore for the paper "Shenjing: A low power reconfigurable neuromorphic accelerator with partial-sum and spike networks-on-chip" if you would like to know more about the whole project.
